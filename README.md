## This program was submitted for Harvard's CS50x course on edX.org.
## You should not be viewing these files if you are taking the course because you will only cheat yourself!

### The program was implements in two ways for comparison:
### dictionary_hsh.c uses a hash table for lookup.
### dictionary_try.c uses a try for loopup
### dictionary.c was actually submitted.  It uses a hash.
